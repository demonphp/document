### switch CASE
```sql
  select case status when 1 then '成功' when 2 then '失败' else '其他' end from user;
   #case后面紧跟要被作为判断的字段
   #when后面跟判断条件
   #then后面跟结果
   #else相当于default
   #end是语句结束语
```

### 示例1
```sql
SELECT a.datadate as active_time,a.idfv,a.ip as active_ip,a.jsondata,a.gid , case WHEN a.idfv is not null then
(select CONCAT(b.datadate,"¤",b.idfv,"¤",b.ip,"¤",b.username) as reginfo from sdk_register as b where b.idfv=a.idfv order by b.datadate desc limit 1) end as reginfo
from sdk_active as a
WHERE 1 AND a.gid in (169) AND a.datadate >= '2018-02-22 00:00:00' AND a.datadate <= '2018-02-23 04:00:00'
```
